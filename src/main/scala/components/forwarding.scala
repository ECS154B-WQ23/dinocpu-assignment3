/**
 * The Forwarding unit
 *
 * Input:  rs1, the register number for which the data is used in the execute stage
 * Input:  rs2, the register number for which the data is used in the execute stage
 * Input:  exmemrd, the destination register for the instruction in the mem stage
 * Input:  exmemrw, true if the instruction in the memory stage needs to write the register file
 * Input:  memwbrd, the destination register for the instruction in the writeback stage
 * Input:  memwbrw, true if the instruction in the writeback stage needs to write the register file
 *
 * Output: forwardA, 0, don't forward. 1, forward from mem stage. 2, forward from wb stage.
 *                   This is used for the "readdata1" forwarding
 * Output: forwardB, 0, don't forward. 1, forward from mem stage. 2, forward from wb stage.
 *                   This is used for the "readdata2" forwarding
 *
 * For more information, see Section 4.7 of Patterson and Hennessy
 * This follows figure 4.53
